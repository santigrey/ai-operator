# SESSION.md ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ Project Ascension
## Date: 2026-03-27 (Day 27 of 60)
## Engineer: James Sloan | Denver, CO

## PROJECT STATE

Project Ascension is running on two parallel tracks that compound each other. Track 1 is a self-hosted production AI platform built on homelab hardware. Track 2 is a complete Anthropic API mastery curriculum built independently in 20 hours. Together they form a single cohesive portfolio that demonstrates both infrastructure depth and API fluency.

## TRACK 1 ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ HOMELAB AI PLATFORM

### Repo: github.com/santigrey/ai-operator

A three-plane distributed AI platform designed to mirror production AI infrastructure at real companies.

### Architecture
- Control Plane: Server 3 (192.168.1.10) ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ FastAPI orchestrator :8000, PostgreSQL + pgvector, MCP server :8001
- Inference Plane: Server 2 (192.168.1.152) ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ Ollama, llama3.1:8b, mxbai-embed-large, Tesla T4 GPU
- Operator Layer: Thin Client 1/JesAir (git/Paco/Cowork), Mac mini (CLI/CC), Thin Client 2/Cortez (Cowork/Windows)

### Alexandra ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ Autonomous AI Agent
- ReAct loop (up to 5 steps), vector memory, full event sourcing
- Tool registry: job_search_jsearch (LinkedIn/Indeed/Glassdoor via JSearch RapidAPI), job_search (Adzuna), web_search (DDG), draft_message (Ollama), ping
- Deduplication guard, JSON bleed guard, clean plain-text answers
- CLI: alexandra "find remote AI Engineer jobs" from Mac mini
- Web dashboard: dark theme, live at http://192.168.1.10:8000/dashboard
- homelab-mcp connected to Claude Desktop on JesAir via SSH stdio (id_ed25519_mcp)
- Cowork autonomously diagnosed and fixed Ollama probe bug using homelab tools

### Agent Network ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ NEW Day 25
- agent_tasks table: id, created_by, assigned_to, status (pending_approval/approved/rejected), title, payload, result, created_at, updated_at
- messages table: id, from_agent, to_agent, thread_id, content, read, created_at
- 5 new homelab-mcp tools: homelab_create_task, homelab_list_tasks, homelab_update_task, homelab_send_message, homelab_read_messages
- Dashboard Agent Tasks section: displays all tasks, Approve/Reject buttons for pending_approval rows
- FastAPI endpoints: POST /tasks/{task_id}/approve, POST /tasks/{task_id}/reject
- End-to-end verified: Paco creates task via MCP ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ PostgreSQL ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ dashboard displays ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ approve/reject works

### Infrastructure Fixes ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ Day 24-25
- SSH passphrase removed permanently from id_ed25519 on JesAir
- SSH command limit raised from 500 to 2000 chars in mcp_server.py

- Phase II-A ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ Alexandra core agent loop and CLI COMPLETE
- Phase II-B ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ Web dashboard COMPLETE
- Phase II-C ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ Portfolio weaponization COMPLETE
- Phase II-D ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ Agent Network foundation COMPLETE (Day 25)
- Phase II-E ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ CC polling loop / autonomous task execution COMPLETE (Day 26)

## TRACK 2 ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ CLAUDE API MASTERY CURRICULUM

### Repo: github.com/santigrey/claude-mastery
### Built: March 24-25, 2026 (~20 hours)

A ground-up Anthropic API curriculum built independently, covering every layer from raw API calls to production agent systems.

### What Was Built
- hello_claude.py ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ raw API call, metadata, model understanding
- streaming.py ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ real-time token delivery
- structured_output.py ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ JSON outputs via system prompt
- conversation_memory.py ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ multi-turn with history management
- tool_use.py ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ single and parallel tool calling
- mcp_integration.py ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ MCP server connection
- react_agent.py ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ ReAct pattern from scratch
- task_planning_agent.py ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ multi-step planning
- production_hardening.py ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ retry logic, error handling, timeouts
- hybrid_inference.py ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ Claude + local Ollama routing
- eval_harness.py ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ automated evaluation, 100% pass rate

## PENDING ITEMS

1. Phase II-E ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ CC polling loop: script on Mac mini that checks agent_tasks and executes approved tasks autonomously
2. Dashboard task approval screenshot for portfolio README
3. Apply to right-level remote AI Engineer roles ($120-160k) via Alexandra job search
4. SESSION.md auto-update at session close

---

## NEXT SESSION PROMPT

### Day 26 Additions
- cc_poller.py on Mac mini: polls agent_tasks every 60s for approved tasks assigned to cc
- macOS 15 NECP workaround: SSH tunnel via Apple-signed ssh binary (localhost:15432Ã¢ÂÂServer3:5432, localhost:18000Ã¢ÂÂServer3:8000)
- launchd service com.ascension.cc-poller running with KeepAlive, verified end-to-end
- Cowork on Cortez connected to homelab-mcp: id_ed25519_mcp key, Windows OpenSSH, split args fix
- Full agent network verified: Paco creates task Ã¢ÂÂ dashboard approve Ã¢ÂÂ CC executes Ã¢ÂÂ completed Ã¢ÂÂ Cowork reads results
- Both thin clients (JesAir + Cortez) now have homelab-mcp access
- Lesson locked in: CC self-correcting prompts own diagnosis+fix tasks autonomously

### NEXT SESSION PROMPT â SUPERSEDED

"Paco Ã¢ÂÂ Day 27. Phase III: job search automation. Use Alexandra + agent_tasks to find 5 right-level remote AI Engineer roles ($120-160k), create tasks for each, approve them, CC drafts applications."

### Day 26 Late Session
- user_profile table created in PostgreSQL (12 rows: identity, goals, preferences, context)
- homelab_get_profile and homelab_update_profile MCP tools live (12 total tools)
- agent.py modified: loads user_profile at start of every run, prepends to system prompt
- Alexandra answered "who am I and what are we building?" correctly from profile â no tools, no prompting
- Alexandra is now a companion with persistent identity context, not just a task executor

### NEXT SESSION PROMPT
"Paco â Day 27. Build Alexandra's proactive daily brief: every morning she wakes up, reads the user profile, checks the task queue, searches for relevant news/jobs, and sends a summary. This is Phase IV."

### Day 27
- daily_brief.py on Server 3: reads user_profile, pending tasks, calls Alexandra agent, stores brief in agent_tasks
- Cron job: runs daily at 7am UTC automatically
- Dashboard Daily Brief section: appears at top of dashboard, shows today's brief on load
- Verified: Alexandra generated morning brief from profile data — job focus, pending tasks, proactive suggestion
- Alexandra now wakes up daily without being asked

### NEXT SESSION PROMPT
"Paco — Day 28. Phase V: wire Gmail and Google Calendar MCP tools into Alexandra so she can read your email and calendar as part of the daily brief and task creation."

- cc_poller.py on Mac mini: polls agent_tasks every 60s, SSH tunnel workaround for macOS 15 NECP, json.dumps fix, rollback fix
- launchd service com.ascension.cc-poller running with KeepAlive
- Phase II-E verified: task created by Paco ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ approved ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ CC executes ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ completed autonomously
- Lesson: CC self-correcting prompts beat manual step-by-step for diagnosis tasks
